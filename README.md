SVM and SVR Machine Learning Project
Description
This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for regression tasks using Python's scikit-learn library in Google Colab. The project includes implementations of these algorithms on example datasets such as the Iris dataset for SVM and the Boston Housing dataset for SVR.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a hands-on implementation of two popular machine learning algorithms:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Used for classifying data into different categories by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Used for predicting continuous values while maintaining a margin of tolerance to control the model complexity and avoid overfitting.
Both algorithms are implemented with different kernels (linear and non-linear) to demonstrate their flexibility in handling different types of data.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for coding the algorithms.
Google Colab: Cloud-based platform for running Jupyter notebooks with free access to GPUs.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for Python, used for implementing SVM and SVR.
NumPy: Library for numerical computations in Python.
Pandas: Data manipulation library for loading and preprocessing datasets.
Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

Open Google Colab.

Upload or clone the notebook from the GitHub repository (if available).

Make sure the following Python packages are installed in your environment:

Results
SVM (Iris Dataset): The model is able to classify the flower species with an accuracy of approximately X%.
SVR (Boston Housing Dataset): The model predicts house prices with a mean squared error (MSE) of X.
You can customize the kernel functions and other hyperparameters to improve the performance of both SVM and SVR models.
